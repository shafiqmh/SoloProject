## The Brief

To create an OOP-based application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training. The application must also allow the manipulation of at least one tables with full CRUD functionality.

### Solution

I decided to create a football teams website/application that allows the user to create teams and leagues, as well as add and remove teams from each league.

## Testing

I have used JUnit and Selenium tests for automated testing and I have run all of my code through Codacy to generate a report too.

## Deployment

I set up GitHub to work with Jenkins so that with every push event, a build, test and deployment process was triggered automatically.

This application can be deployed both locally and externally through a virtual machine.
